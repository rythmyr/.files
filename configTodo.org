* vim
** TODO play around with neomake or ale instead of syntastic (may be better? IDK)
- [[https://github.com/w0rp/ale][ale]]
- [[https://github.com/neomake/neomake][neomake]]
** TODO update the "npm-based projects" section to search parent directories for package.json
* emacs
** TODO figure out a good way to get sensible-defaults.el automatically
** TODO get magit working in emacs
** TODO figure out a good way to update all installed packages
this might already be built into use-package or package.el

setq package-selected-packages might be helpful
** TODO set up tide to use keyboard shortcuts similar to my vim setup
evil-define-key is probably the elisp function I want.
Might need to take mappings out of the :bind use-package setting
* tmux
** TODO mess around with tmux settings
** TODO configure <prefix>h-l to do the same thing as the arrow keys
* colors
** TODO dmenu
** TODO emacs
this one is going to be a bit harder all of the solarized dark colors were built into a package I downloaded
vim uses the terminal colors so it just kind of works
** TODO rofi
* i3
** TODO i3blocks - figure out how exactly to configure that
** TODO manually map workspaces 1-3 to displays
I'm tired of the inconsistency between work and home (1 being left vs center, respectively)
** TODO configure i3 to load my layout immediately upon starting      :work:
* zsh
** TODO prompt - fix prompt when inside of the .git directory of a git repo
** TODO BUG: prompt - shows both full path and relative path when following a symlink to git versioned directory
** TODO move some entries from .zshenv to an env.zsh, which will get sourced everytime
* misc
** TODO stow - Add configurations for different programs to the stow repo
** TODO cfg - if file doesn't exist in one place, copy the file
also shouldn't have to worry about permissions this way
** TODO cfg - accept multiple file arguments
should function similar to git's mergetool, where each file opens in a split separately
when one is done (:qa), should open the next file in a split
** TODO keybinds - figure out how to bind CAPS + hjkl to simulate arrow keys
- look into using xkbcomp
** TODO screenshot - fix the script to not spam q after feh closes
** TODO newscript - don't hardcode the scripts directory
** TODO newscript - check to make sure the script they're trying to create doesn't already exist
** TODO scripts - command line utilities (e.g. cfg) from window scripting things (e.g. emacsnotes)
** TODO Move this list of todos into its own org file in the dotfile repo
** TODO find a good command line file manager
** TODO home - save my public IP address in a file in keybase
Run script every 5 minutes to make sure it's always up-to-date
Should only run on my home computer
** TODO backups - backup the keybase org directory every week or so
if keybase disappears, I don't want to lose everything
** TODO backups - backup the keybase art directory every week or so
this isn't as big of a deal, but I don't really want to lose my art, either. Some of those can't be redownloaded
** Archive :ARCHIVE:

Will probably move to stow for this. It complicates some things, but makes a lot of things a lot easier
* Archive                                                           :ARCHIVE:
This is the old archive from when I saved the todo in keybase, I'm not bothering to categorize it into each of the subtrees.
From now on, each of those subtrees will have their own archive
** BLOCKED symlink ~/org to /keybase/rythmyr/private/org so notes are preserved across computers

Can't actually do this, that folder doesn't actually exist, so symlinking fails. Alternative workaround was to just open the /keybase file directly on startup
** BLOCKED update git config to automatically remove extra branch name on update
:PROPERTIES:
:ARCHIVE_TIME: 2019-04-03 Wed 19:28

  my cfg script is probably good enough. It's fairly easy to work with.
- [ ] script that symlinks from files to a dotfiles repo?
  - [ ] iterates over each item in repo, if file doesn't exist or symlink doesn't exist, create symlink
  - [ ] maybe remove dead symlinks?
    - hard to do, involves going through my entire home directory, searching for links that go to dotfiles

vim is ok at adding whitespace when you go to a new line, but doesn't add any when you enter insert mode on a blank line
turns out this is built in - cc (change line) adds the witespace automatically
