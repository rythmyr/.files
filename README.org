1. Clone the repo into a folder in your home directory, e.g. =cd ~; git clone --recursive git@github.com:rythmyr/.files=
2. in the directory you cloned it into, run =./setup.zsh=
3. It'll tell you if you have any conflicts for each package, but won't do anything for any of the packages if any of them have conflicts
4. If you want to install just a single package, you can use =stow <package>=
